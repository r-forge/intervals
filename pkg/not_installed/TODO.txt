- (6 April 2008) If we force an integer data type for "Z" interval matrices,
  perhaps this will keep users from inserting invalid endpoints into an existing
  object. Although perhaps not... R will just update the matrix data type on the
  fly, and will probably not call the validity function for the containing
  object. 

  (5 May 2008) An alternative here -- one which is probably more natural -- is
  to just determine endpoint type on the basis of the data types of the
  matrices. One or more real-valued matrices causes real-line
  computation. Possibly provide a utility L(), to make numeric matrices
  integral, generating a warning if rounding is required. Also add a switch to
  all functions which behaves in the same way.

  It should be the case that we ALWAYS use the type() accessor for checking and
  setting matrix types -- except in class definitions, initialize methods, and
  the definition of the type() accessors themselves. If so, it will be simple to
  drop the explicit slot and do as described in the preceeding paragraphs.

- (7 May 2008) In the end, I should probably leave accessors intact but NOT use
  replacement methods in my own code -- since these create efficiency problems
  due to copying.

- (30 May 2008) Consider replacing coerce methods with setAs. In particular,
  it's disappointing to see that as.matrix doesn't work currently.

- (1 June 2008) PSEUDO-CODE FOR R all.equal.numeric

    - Set tolerance = .Machine$double.eps^0.5.

    - Only check non-NA pairs for which == fails.

    - Set xy to the mean absolute difference (along the vectors).

    - Set xn to the mean absolute target.

    - If xn > tolerance, make a relative comparison and set xy to
      xy/xn. Otherwise, make an absolute comparison and leave xy as it is.

    - Return equality iff xy <= tolerance.

  Note: dropping entries for which == holds is important, as it affects the means
  below. We will, however most likely apply our procedure to single pairs of
  numbers, so it won't matter: if == holds, then the relative difference is 0 in
  any case. An important issue: R's relative difference is abs( tar - cur )  /
  tar. The traditional definition, however, is abs( tar - cur ) / max( tar, cur
  ). On the other hand, the comp.lang.c FAQ first uses R's version, then the
  traditional relative difference.

  THIS IS NOW FINISHED FOR BOTH INTERVAL_UNION AND INTERVAL_OVERLAP.

- (10 June 2008) More functions to implement (based largely on the e-mail from
  Julien on 12 February 2008):

    - The subset version of interval_overlap: interval_included.

    - A set difference.

    - Distance to nearest and which nearest. These might return functions rather
      than/in addition to just values.

    - Another class for points? Or do we just let the user do this on their own,
      with closed-endpoint real intervals of size 0? Probably best not to bother
      with this one. We should, for example, make a new interval_overlap method
      where the query set is points -- a vector of positions -- rather than an
      inteval object.

    - The iapply idea: given a vector of positions, and a vector of values,
      compute intersections then and apply a function to the appropriate subset
      vector. 

    - Julien's "density" idea: a function which, for any position and window size,
      tells you the portion of the window overlapping intervals in the set of
      interest.  

    - A thresholding function like hit.intervals in intervaltools.

- (19 August 2008)

    - A sort method. Do we use sorting anywhere else in our code? If so, it would
      be good to replace ad hoc sorting with the standard method. Note that
      reduce (and thus interval_union) already do sorting, but it would be nice
      to have another form of sorting that respects the set-of-intervals
      interpretation of a given object.

    - A good summary() method for large objects.

    - Note that we can put a manually manipulated version of index.html in
      inst/doc and this will be used instead of the automatically generated
      one. 

- (21 August 2008)

   - Be very clear in the documentation/vignette that objects can be thought of
     either as a set of possibly non-disjoint intervals -- whose composition is
     respected by things link interval_overlap, which_nearest, empty, size,
     etc. -- or as representations of subsets of the integers or the real line
     -- a conceptualization more consistent with distance_to_nearest,
     interval_union, interval_intersection, interval_complement, sets. In fact,
     I need to make a vignette.

   - From Julien, it would be good to have one-sided distance_to_nearest,
     which_nearest, etc. Due to discontinuity, these are a bit trickier to
     implement. 

   - Implement sort and is_sorted, which work in set-of-intervals mode rather
     than subset of Z/R mode.

- (22 August 2008)

   - After talking with Simon and Julien a bit, and playing with some large data
     examples in the overview vignette that create, by chance very small and/or
     closely spaced intervals with large absolute value, I have realized that
     the relative difference approach to equality (i) is currently causing some
     surprising errors/results do to unsorted "sorted" positions, and (ii)
     probably needs to be expanded to be safe and usable.

     A suggestion is to operate in two modes over the reals:

     1. Assume that internal represetnations of real numbers are literaly
        equally if and only if they are intended to be equal, and that the user
        is aware of this. Further, promise not to break this with any function
        in the package, i.e., don't do any math on endpoints, just combine or
        drop as calculations require.

     2. Provide a gap smoothing tool that the user can use to remove small gaps
        in subsets of R which aren't really intended, but may have arisen from
        round errors elsewhere. I.e., take an intervals object and brush it up
        so that any gaps of size <= tol, or a relative difference (with respect
        to gap endpoints) <= tol, are removed. After that, procede as in case 1.

- (13 January 2009)

  - Write/activate as.matrix for my objects.

  - For test harness, make sure NULL and empty Intervals/Intervals_full objects
    are handled gracefully in places where they could conceivably be used.
