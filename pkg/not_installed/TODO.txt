- (7 May 2008) In the end, I should probably leave accessors intact but NOT use
  replacement methods in my own code -- since these create efficiency problems
  due to copying.

- (10 June 2008) More functions to implement (based largely on the e-mail from
  Julien on 12 February 2008):

    - The subset version of interval_overlap: interval_included.

    - Another class for points? Or do we just let the user do this on their own,
      with closed-endpoint real intervals of size 0? Probably best not to bother
      with this one. We should, for example, make a new interval_overlap method
      where the query set is points -- a vector of positions -- rather than an
      inteval object.

    - The iapply idea: given a vector of positions, and a vector of values,
      compute intersections then and apply a function to the appropriate subset
      vector. 

    - Julien's "density" idea: a function which, for any position and window size,
      tells you the portion of the window overlapping intervals in the set of
      interest.  

    - A thresholding function like hit.intervals in intervaltools.

    - A sort method. Do we use sorting anywhere else in our code? If so, it would
      be good to replace ad hoc sorting with the standard method. Note that
      reduce (and thus interval_union) already do sorting, but it would be nice
      to have another form of sorting that respects the set-of-intervals
      interpretation of a given object.

    - A good summary() method for large objects.

    - Note that we can put a manually manipulated version of index.html in
      inst/doc and this will be used instead of the automatically generated
      one. 

- (21 August 2008)

  - From Julien, it would be good to have one-sided distance_to_nearest,
     which_nearest, etc. Due to discontinuity, these are a bit trickier to
     implement. 

   - Implement sort and is_sorted, which work in set-of-intervals mode rather
     than subset of Z/R mode.

- (22 August 2008)

   - After talking with Simon and Julien a bit, and playing with some large data
     examples in the overview vignette that create, by chance very small and/or
     closely spaced intervals with large absolute value, I have realized that
     the relative difference approach to equality (i) is currently causing some
     surprising errors/results do to unsorted "sorted" positions, and (ii)
     probably needs to be expanded to be safe and usable.

     A suggestion is to operate in two modes over the reals:

     1. Assume that internal represetnations of real numbers are literaly
        equally if and only if they are intended to be equal, and that the user
        is aware of this. Further, promise not to break this with any function
        in the package, i.e., don't do any math on endpoints, just combine or
        drop as calculations require.

     2. Provide a gap smoothing tool that the user can use to remove small gaps
        in subsets of R which aren't really intended, but may have arisen from
        round errors elsewhere. I.e., take an intervals object and brush it up
        so that any gaps of size <= tol, or a relative difference (with respect
        to gap endpoints) <= tol, are removed. After that, procede as in case 1.

 - For test harness, make sure NULL and empty Intervals/Intervals_full objects
    are handled gracefully in places where they could conceivably be
    used. Things which must be tested:

    - Objects with NA entries. 

    - Objects with empty entries.

    - Objects with no intervals.

    - Objects with just one interval.

  - Bugs

    - 'a <- new( "Intervals_full", NA )' produces logicals in the endpoints, but
      this is not caught by validity checking. Trying to work with the object
      produces errors later. See comment below on validity checking...

  - With R 2.8.1, validity checking does not seem to be happening for newly
    created objects. I should always be passing final control on to the "ANY"
    method for "initialize", which calls validObject(). Look into this...

  - Rather than have lots of check_valid arguments everywhere, have my package
    create a global option which the user can set. Even better, do this and then
    keep the method-level arguments, so the user can turn it off by default but
    then still activate it in certain cases.

- (22 January 2009)

  - In trying to remap Affymetrix probes for their C. elegans expression array,
    I used Intervals_full or GenomeIntervals objects. Splitting one large object
    into thousands of smaller ones -- one per gene model -- took a very long
    time. Is this a property of how split() works? Of all of the S4 overhead for
    a large number of objects? Do some profiling here and get this sorted out...

    (Possibly related to use of factors? The split() code seems to have a hard
    time with these in some circumstances.)
